what is object oriented Programming :(oop)
Classes and Object:
it is simply way of writing code
we have to follow some rules .
there are other way like  Functional Programming ,procedural Programming.
there are 4-main pillars of oop
1. Inheritance
2.Polymorphism
3.Abstraction
4.Encapsulation
why we should learn OOP ::
1) Clean Code ///Re -usability.
2)security protected code.
3)its easier to write large amount of code.
4)sharing code with others become easier.
5)changing code become easier. For Eg: updates of software

Object :
an object is something that we can physically touch .
everything around us is an object like table chair.
we can represent object inside our computers by telling a computer
how an object looks and how it behaves.

Class:
 a class is like design /blue print/map that we use to create objects.

String Class:
(Most Widely used)
string class is used to store and manipulate text based data.
most of the information inside computers is processed in this form.

Creating objects from string class .
String name =new String();
String name= "valie";
1)lenght() - no of characters
2)isEmpty() - return boolean value check string has empty or not
